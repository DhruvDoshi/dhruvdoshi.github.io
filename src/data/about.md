# Some history

- I got my first computer at the age of 13, after that we installed wifi. For next two years I learned everything regarding them like how they works and all and developed the interest in designing my own!

- At age of 16, I concluded that I will work in computer field only and develop what I dreamt about!

- At age of 17, I got into [SilverOak College](https://www.silveroakuni.ac.in/) for my B.E. in Computer Engineering.

- After getting in the university I was just chilling and started watching series and did nothing for next 2 year!ðŸ˜… Continuing that i started visiting events and eventually loved computer science field and security domain especially. leading me into Blockchian and Artificial Intelligence.

- In this period I made three products and pitched them for investment and sucessfully got into the first round but due to chnage of plans I was not able to continue with it. This is the peak COVID-19 time!

- I started my masters with Dalhousie Univeristy and moved to canada for the further studies and man o man, this was difficult!

- Will write further story soon ðŸ˜…

- Currently I'm working to make world more secure and safeguard the data of users.


Ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
