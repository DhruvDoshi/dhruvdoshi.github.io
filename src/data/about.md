I'm Dhruv, a lifetime student who is always learning new skills and a natural geek. In my extra time, I also manage my research project [DCS-BBN](https://dhruv25071999.wixsite.com/dcs-bbn). I am particularly interested in projects that focus on health and safety, imaging, social impact, and Blockchain. If I can be helpful to you or you would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.

# Some history

- I got my first computer at the age of 13, and we installed wifi after that. For the next two years, I learned everything regarding them, like how they work and all and developed an interest in designing my own!

- At 16, I concluded that I would only work in the computer field and develop what I dreamt about!

- At 17, I got into [SilverOak College](https://www.silveroakuni.ac.in/) for my B.E. in Computer Engineering.

- After getting into the university, I was just chilling and started watching series and did nothing for the next 2 years!ðŸ˜… Continuing that, I started visiting events and eventually loved the computer science field and security domain especially. Leading me into blockchain and Artificial Intelligence.

- During this period, I made three products, pitched them for investment, and successfully got into the first round, but due to a change of plans, I could not continue with it. This is the peak COVID-19 time!

- I started my master's at Dalhousie University and moved to Canada for further studies, and man o, man, this was difficult!

- Will write a further story soon ðŸ˜…

- Currently, I'm working to make the world more secure and safeguard users' data.


Ask me in person for other stories I'm afraid to share on the internet.
